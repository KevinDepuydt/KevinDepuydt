### Hi there 👋 Welcome to my GitHub profile!

I'm Kevin, a developer curious and passionate about web technologies, developing and building things **since 2014**.

I particularly ❤️ technologies and frameworks of the JavaScript ecosystem (React, Node.js, TypeScript, Next.js...),
they allow to create efficient websites and applications, and can adapt perfectly to any type of project.

I have a strong knowledge of the front-end development which I find more and more challenging 
as new technologies tends to put the complexity on it, but I also like building back-ends, services and APIs!
Today the perfect job for me is the one that allow me to work on both sides of an application, 
and contribute to the design and development of every single pieces of the project.

I'm currently working as a **Freelance** developer, so if you are looking for someone to help you with your project, or even if you just want to discuss, feel free to reach me:
