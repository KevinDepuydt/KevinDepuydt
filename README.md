### Hi there 👋 Welcome to my GitHub profile!

I'm Kevin, a developer curious and passionate about web technologies, developing and building things **since 2014**.

I particularly ❤️ technologies and frameworks of the **JavaScript ecosystem** (React, Node, TypeScript, Next, Nest, ...),
they allow to create efficient websites and applications, and can adapt perfectly to any type of project.

I have a strong knowledge of the **Front-end** development which I find more and more challenging 
as new technologies tends to put the complexity on it, but I also like building **Back-end**s, **Services** and **API**s!

<!--
Today the perfect job for me is the one that allow me to work on both sides of an application, 
and contribute to the design and development of every single pieces of the project.
-->

I'm currently working as a **Freelance** developer from France 🇫🇷. 
Feel free to reach me from links in my profile if you are looking for someone 
to help you with your project, or if you just want to chat 😄
